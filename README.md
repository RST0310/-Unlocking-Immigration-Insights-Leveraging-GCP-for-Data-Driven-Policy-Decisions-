As a member of Group 9, our team embarked on a comprehensive project aimed at dissecting the intricacies of immigrant and noncitizen interactions in the United States amidst evolving immigration trends and regulations. By leveraging a dataset encompassing various facets such as immigrants achieving lawful permanent resident status, refugee arrivals, noncitizen apprehensions, removals, and returns, our objective was to discern trends, patterns, and potential correlations within these data points. Through meticulous analysis, we sought to unveil valuable insights into immigration dynamics over time, with the ultimate goal of informing policymakers, immigration authorities, and scholars for more informed decision-making. Our team's proficiency in data analysis, coupled with our deep understanding of immigration patterns and policy implications, positioned us as valuable assets for potential employment by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). By harnessing our data-driven insights, USCIS could expedite application processes, enhance border security measures, and identify areas for system improvement, thereby fulfilling its mandate of administering immigration services efficiently while upholding national security and the principles of the American immigration system. The queries developed for our dataset not only facilitated nuanced exploration of the data but also provided USCIS with valuable tools for policy formulation, resource allocation, fraud detection, performance evaluation, and customer service enhancement. Our contributions underscored the pivotal role of data analysis in shaping effective immigration management strategies, reaffirming our commitment to driving impactful change in this critical domain.
